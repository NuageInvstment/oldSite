						<h4>April 20, 2014</h4>
						<p>Here is a reflection that I have on EB-5 projects after the AREAA Global & Luxury Summit conference in NYC. </p><br>
<p>Here are some thoughts for you to consider:</p><br>
<p>WHAT ARE EB-5 INVESTMENTS?</p><br>
<p>EB-5 investment is an investment in a private equity by a foreign investor in return for a US green card. Visa issuance is the most common challenge students face today when applying for a job after graduation. Eb-5 is the quickest way for a long-term and secure stay in the US. With the school year coming to an end, we thought it would be the perfect timing to do a session for students to understand how this investment might work to their advantage.</p><br>
<p>EB-5 programs started in 1990. The current quota is 10,000 applicant/year. EB-5 projects can be but not limited to real-estate development projects as long as it creates jobs. The investment is $1 million except for unemployment targeted areas (where unemployment rate is 150%above the national average) which requires only $500k of investment. There are two types of EB-5 investment; direct and indirect. Direct investment is done with investors directly investing their money into a project where only number of direct jobs can be counted. Most of this type of investments are restaurants. Indirect investment is done through a Regional Center where indirect jobs can be counted. Most of this type of investments are hotel development because this it requires a large amount of capital and the number of job creation can count indirect jobs such as the local restaurants and shops created by additional tourist attraction.</p><br><br>
<p>HOW TO REDUCE RISKS WHEN INVESTING IN EB-5 PROJECTS?</p><br>
<p>Risk can be reduced but never be eliminated with any investments. The only way to reduce risk is by conducting adequate due diligence on the project prior to investment. We have narrow down to a few important questions for you to ask the sponsor in order to compare the different projects in the market. EB-5 investment essentially is like a loan so you need to think as an investor, more importantly as a lender.</p><br>
<p>1) Evaluate business plan- It is better to pick a business model that you understand. You should be able to do on-site due diligence. How does their team look like?
2) Evaluate the financials-How are they getting the rest of the capital; % commercial loans vs. % of EB-5 investments (EB-5 capital are mostly used as bridge loan) What is the interest? What is their ability to repay? Do they own the land?
3) Evaluate their track record-How many development deals have they done in the past? Are they successful? 
4) Evaluate the job creation- Where are the jobs coming from?</p><br>
<p>It is important to acknowledge the potential risks and the type of risks involved. There are two types of risks with EB5 investments:</p><br>
<p>1) Financial risk---risk of not receiving your principal: Financial risk is mainly due to the business itself.
a. Insufficient Capital
b. Poor Management
c. Lack of planning
d. Over expansion
e. Mistaken estimates of market demand 
f. Failure to select and use outside professional advisors and internal controls
g. Over dependence on a single individual or predict specific event
h. Poor timing of expenditures & cash flow
i. Lack of competitive advantage</p><br>
<p>2) Immigration risk----I-526 is a conditional green card and an I-829 approval removes all conditions. If I-829 is not approved, we call it an immigration failure. 
A successful I-829 removal of conditions requires:
a. Evidence that new commercial enterprise was established
b. Investor made full investment into New Commercial Enterprise
c. Full investment was sustained at risk
d. The job creation requirements were met for each investor (one $500k or 1000K investment needs to create 10 full time jobs).</p>
