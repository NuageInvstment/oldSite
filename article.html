						<h3 class="color1 v2">Economic Expectations (Forecast into 2014 housing market) Conference Review</h3>

						<h4>November 27, 2013</h4>
						<p>Last week, I attended the Economic Expectations (Forecast into 2014 housing market) conference at the Federal Reserve Bank. Over 250 real-estate professionals come together to hear a speech given by Lawrence Yun (Chief Economist/Senior VP of Research of National Association of REALTORS) and Barry Bluestone (Professor of Political Economy and Dean of Public Policy & Urban Affairs at Northeastern University).</p><br>
<p>Most of the topics of discussion are in line with what I have mentioned in my seminar. I highlighted a few main points below:
<p>1. House price appreciation is driven by the following factors: a. Interest rates b. household growth c. new home construction d. existing home sales e. job growth.</p><br>
<p>2. Demographic outlook for the next decade: a. Minorities are forecasted to add 7.5 million households, from 25% to 33% of all US household over the next 20 years. b. Decline in household size-Number of people living alone is expected to rise by 5 million. Number of elderly empty nesters, divorce rates and declining remarriage rates are key drivers of this growth.</p><br>
<p>3. Mortgage rate is expected to rise up to 5.3% by end of 2014. This will significantly decrease the number of refinancing. Lending restrictions are still tight and still hinders a lot of home buyers from getting mortgages.</p><br>
<p>4. Growing trend in international buyers and cash buyers, which comprised of 1/3 of todayâ€™s transactions.</p><br>
<p>5. Number of new construction is growing but slowly: Construction loans (none government guaranteed) are considered risky assets for banks which make loans extremely difficult to obtain. Large builders are raising private debt to substitute construction loans. (Hence the growth in Eb-5 projects I assume).</p><br>
<p>6. Rent in Boston will continue to rise. It is currently the third highest in the US, after San Francisco and New York. Inflation is expected in 2015 and will drive the rent prices further.</p><br>
<p>7. Shift in housing demand, especially in the younger population. Growing demand in condominiums and preference for urban lifestyle. We also see a lot of shift from single family to multi-family units. Affordability will become key in the younger generation as most of them have significant debt to pay off after college.</p><br>
<p>8. Overall, the housing market in Boston remain fairly steady, far less volatile than CA and Los Vegas. I still have a lot of faith in the real-estate sector in 2014, especially in Boston. </p><br>
<p>I hope this will help paint a backdrop of what we have experienced and what the year will look like for 2014.</p>
